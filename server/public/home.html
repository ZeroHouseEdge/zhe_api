         <h2>A sports bettor's dream</h2>
         <p>
         In the gambling industry, the odds are stacked against the bettor, who will lose money in the long run in favor of the house. The house taking the bets charge from 2%-10% on every bet, plus fees when you deposit and withdraw your money. At ZeroHouseEdge, we flipped the script; there is no house. Using cutting edge Bitcoin & Blockchain technology, ZeroHouseEdge has developed software to make gambling free on the internet for the first time in history. Sorry bookies, it was only a matter of time.

            <p>
            We've designed ZeroHouseEdge to be as secure as possible. With that in mind, we made ZeroHouseEdge an application that runs on your machine. All keys and funds will be stored on your machine locally. That way if we get attacked by a hacker somehow, they still do not have access to your private keys or funds because no valuable data lives on our server.

            <h3>Get Bitcoin</h3>
            <p>
               Bitcoin, the digital version of cash, is the most important invention in years. One of the reasons is that it allows money and code to meld and create revolutionary technology. You can use ZeroHouseEdge in many currencies, such as the US Dollar, but to first deposit you need Bitcoin.

            <h3>Create and accept bets</h3>
            <p>
               At ZeroHouseEdge there is zero house, lol. But seriously, users bet with each other. You are your own bookie: create your own bets, set your own lines, accept proposed bets from other users, and withdraw and deposit at your leisure. All for free, no catch. When a netowork of bettors come together to use revolutionary software, we end up saving billions of dollars.
