            <h3><a href="#1"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How does Jackschess help me as a player?</h3>
            <p>Jackschess gives you the ability to connect with any chess player in the world and all the necessary tools-- all in one screen--to create the perfect online chess environment. Not only can you review with coaches one-on-one or in groups, but you can also hop on to review a game you just played with your opponent, show your friends all over the world your last tourney games, and more.</p>
            <p>There is a big disconnect between the learning experience you get in-person with other players and what you get online from sites like chess.com, ICC, chess24, etc. No matter how good technology gets, Tactics Trainer will never be as good as a titled player reviewing your games and openings with you. Jackschess brings that in-person experience to the internet.</p>

            <h3><a href="#2"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How does Jackschess help me as a coach?</h3>
            <p>Jackschess will help you teach chess better online, and potentially get you more students.</p>
            <p>Nobody likes having to manage Skype/ICC or chess.com in the same screen, not to mention clunky tools like TeamViewer or programs that only Windows users can download. Group lessons are always a mess, you don't have all the features you need, etc. Skype and those websites aren't meant for a chess-learning environment. Jackschess is. Jackschess isn't designed for multiple purposes; it is meant to create the optimal chess environment for players to connect and enjoy the game all over the internet.</p>
            <p>Jackschess also features accounts specifically for coaches. Having an account lets you have your own Jackschess room at your own personal URL. You also get a coach's toolbox where you can save positions, puzzles, games, recrodings, etc. for later reuse in other lessons.</p>

            <h3><a href="#3"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How much does Jackschess cost?</h3>
            <p><b>Free!</b> At this point, using Jackschess costs anything at all. I'm not sure what jackschess.com's plan is for the future, so for now I'm just a 21-year-old programmer trying to help the game of chess and the people who play it.</p>

            <h3><a href="#4"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>What's the difference between a Jackschess room and a jackschess account?</h3>
            <p>Great question.</p>
            <p>A chess room is a place on the internet where you have video chat, a chess board, and a bunch of chess-specific features all in one screen. It is hosted at a unique URL that you can share to invite whomever you want. However, a chess room is hosted at a random URL, anyone can join it, and you cannot save any data like positions, puzzles, games, etc.</p>
            <p>An account comes with your own profile to market yourself as a coach or student, and it comes with your own personal chess room. Your own chess room is hosted at a customized URL. For example, my username is "JimmyMow," so my room is http://jackschess.com/jimmymow/room. Because I have an account, that room is also protected by a password--or what I call a "room secret"--so that only the people to whom you give your secret can enter your room. Moreover, an account comes with a toolbox, with which you can save positions, games, puzzles, lessons, etc.</p>
